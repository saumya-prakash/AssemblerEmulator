# AssemblerEmulator

A 2-pass assembler for a simple instruction set, along with an emulator to run the assembled programs.

If assembly is successful, a listing file and an object file is produced. A log file is also produced to show warnings.

The object file generated is executable on the included Emulator only.

There is no support for linking multiple object-files. Every program written in this instruction set should be in one program file only.
